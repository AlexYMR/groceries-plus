# CPS-377-Final-Project
**Very small web application for getting good prices on groceries.**

_TO DO:_

- [x] *INDEX PAGE*
- [x] *ITEM PAGE*
- [X] *FOODS PAGE*
- [x] *STORES PAGE*
- [x] Make sure index works properly--right now using select * from Stores;
- [x] Develop query to minimize item prices
- [x] *LOGIN PAGE*
- [x] ~~*SUMMARY PAGE*~~

**Questions:**
1. Should we allow users to make new accounts? I say it's not even worth it for this.
2. Are non-nulls set up properly on the database? (Most things should not be allowed to be null, if any)
3. How should price ties be handled? What might be a secondary characteristic used to break ties?
4. What more quering can we add to make this more robust on the database side of things?

_There are many details in-between._
